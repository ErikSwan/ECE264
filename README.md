# Erik's ECE 264 Work
This repository contains all of the assignments and exams I completed for the Spring 2015 semester of ECE 264 at Purdue University, as taught by Professor Bob Givan.

All C code has been targeted to compile using GCC and the C89 language standard, with all warnings and errors enabled:

`gcc -Wall -Wshadow -g input.c -o output`

### To intrepid Googlers, please read carefully:

The assignments and exams in this repository were completed by Erik Swan for the Spring 2015 section of ECE 264.

Although I have made them available publicly under the MIT license, you should be well aware that submitting *any* portion of this code as your own work is academically dishonest.

Considering that this file and the corresponding GitHub project have been indexed by Google and are likely to show up among the top results for "ECE 264", you should assume that using any of this code will quite easily be flagged by the anti-cheating tools the teaching team likely has in place.

You are probably paying over a hundred thousand dollars for a degree. Don't be dumb. Do your work.
