to use the tester, do the following:

1. compile call_make_words.c to a file called p1.o
   gcc -c -g call_make_words.c -o p1.o

2. compile call_general_make_words to a file called p4.o
   gcc -c -g call_general_make_words.c -o p4.o

3. change line 4 in tester
   old: OBJPATH="/usr/share/exams/exam3_extras"
   new: OBJPATH="."

make sure p1.o, p4.o, and the samples/ directory are all in the same folder as
the tester script.
