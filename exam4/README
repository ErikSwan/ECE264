EXAM 4

PROBLEMS ONE AND TWO  (30% each)

The first two problems ask you to complete two C programs that are
provided by us in mostly complete form.  The details are described in the .c
files and the hidestrings.h file.

There is a Makefile provided that can make either program.
   "make hidestrings" will make the executable hidestrings from hidestrings.c.
   "make restorestrings" will make the executable restorestrings from restorestrings.c.

You should not have to modify any part of those files except the ALL
CAPS COMMENTS where you are requested to place code.

Each program stands alone (has its own main() function) and is
controlled from the command line as described in the help message it
prints out if given no arguments.


We provide sample inputs and outputs for hidestrings in the directory samples/
The inputs and outputs for restorestrings are just the reverse of those for hidestrings.


PROBLEM THREE, A to H (5% each)

Modify the files lists.h and listfunctions.c as described therein.

The file listmain.c is provided to compile with listfunctions.c and provide command-line testing.

Use "make listmain" to make the executable listmain that does this command-line testing.


ALL PROBLEMS

In addition to sample inputs and outputs, a tester script that tests a few
testcases for each problem is provided.  The tester script does not run a check
for memory errors. Also, note that the grading scripts will very likely be more
sophisticated (and test more corner cases) than the tester script.
