On the first part, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to swap the strings by
swapping their data, or by changing how the strings were passed to the function
and swap the strings by swapping the pointers themselves. I tried the first 
approach but struggled for a long time with getting segmentation faults. 
Eventually I realized this was because of the way the strings were initialized 
in main:

>   const char * str1 = "one";

Because the strings are declared like this, the actual string ("one") is
stored in the read-only portion of the memory allocated for the process, and
str1 simply contains the address of this location in memory. If you try to
swap the data at the locations str1 and str2, you will get a segmentation
fault because you are attempting to modify the read-only portion of the
program's memory. I ended up having swapString take two 'char **' and
modifying the pointers of str1 and str2 directly. It would be helpful if it
was discussed/explained why the first approach doesn't work.
